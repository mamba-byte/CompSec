Optimizers applied:
* Zero-Byte
* Not-Iterated
* Single-Salt
* Raw-Hash
* Uses-64-Bit

ATTENTION! Pure (unoptimized) backend kernels selected.
Pure kernels can crack longer passwords, but drastically reduce performance.
If you want to switch to optimized kernels, append -O to your commandline.
See the above message to find out about the exact limits.
